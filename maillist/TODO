Rewriter doesn't handle non-UTF8 encoded text correctly.  It carries over the
non-UTF8 charset designation, but any bytes that aren't valid UTF8 get replaced
with 0xFFFD (diamond-question-mark), which gets rendered as ï¿½ or something
equally useless in the other charset.

Need to add more logging so that we can monitor what happens.

Need to be notified when there are errors.

Do we want to rely on SES's list management and subscription features?

Some lists (admin, group info lists) should be essentially unmoderated.  Maybe
still moderate them for spam, virus, etc., but not for sender.

Clean up message files after we're done with them.

Update list data synchonously with website change rather than periodically.

Extra spacing added to plain text bodies.

Don't quote people's names on the From line.
