Need to be notified when there are errors.

Do we want to rely on SES's list management and subscription features?

Some lists (admin, group info lists) should be essentially unmoderated.  Maybe
still moderate them for spam, virus, etc., but not for sender.

Clean up message files after we're done with them.

Update list data synchonously with website change rather than periodically.

Don't quote people's names on the From line.

Need to decode base64 and qp to find [MOD]MSGID line.
