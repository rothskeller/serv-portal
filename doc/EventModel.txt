== Basic Information ==

Events are uniquely identified by a positive integer ID.  Events have a name,
date, start time, end time, and details.  The name is free form text, which must
be unique among events on that date.  Dates are times are stored and manipulated
as strings, not time.Time objects.  Dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format and times are
in 24-hour HH:MM format (no seconds, always local time).  The details block is
free-form text; it can have <a> tags for hyperlinks, but no other tags.  (It is
sanitized of other tags on input.)

== Venues ==

Each event can have a venue, which is a reference to a separate Venue object.
Venues are identified by a positive integer ID, and have a name, address, city,
and map URL.  The address, city, and map URL are optional.  (We don't store a
state because nothing we do is outside of California, and we don't store a zip
code because we have no need for it.)  If an event does not have a venue, its
location is displayed as "TBD".

== Roles ==

Each event has one or more roles "invited" to it, which means that holders of
those roles can see the event in their calendar.  It also means that their names
are listed as possibilities when recording attendance at the event.  Each role
is associated with zero or more SERV groups (usually one).  The union of all
SERV groups across all roles invited to the event gives the set of SERV groups
for the event itself.

== Classification: SERV Groups and Types ==

Every event has a set of zero or more SERV groups (usually one), derived from
the SERV groups of the invited roles as described above.  The calendar and event
list pages display each different SERV group as a different-colored dot.  An
event with multiple groups gets multiple dots.  In addition, the list of SERV
groups for an event is displayed on the event's page.  The SERV groups for an
event are not directly editable; you have to change the set of roles invited to
the event, or the SERV groups associated with those roles.

Every event also has a set of zero or more event types (usually one).  These are
not visible on the calendar, but they are shown on the individual event pages,
and they are used in report generation.

A real-world data model would allow each invited role to have a different event
type.  For example, a CERT Graduation is a class with respect to its students,
but a drill with respect to SARES participants.  However, that complexity is
unnecessary and unhelpful.  Listing all of the event types and all of the SERV
groups for an event, without correlating them, is good enough and much simpler.
Graduation, for example, might be shown as
    Class, Drill, Party for CERT-D, CERT-T, SARES

Report generation needs a single event type for each event.  The event types are
implicitly ranked, and the highest-ranking event type for an event is used when
reporting on that event.

== Attendance ==

The system tracks attendance at each event.  Only people holding the roles
invited to the event are listed on the attendance tracking page.  The attendance
data model is binary, not trinary: attendance not recorded is the same as
absent.
