This site allows public registration for classes.  At present there are three
class types:  PEP, PPDE, and CERT.  Additional types may be added in the future.

When someone clicks the "Register" button on a class, the first step is to get
them logged in.  If they already are, great.  Otherwise, they will be given a
page allowing either login to existing account or creation of a new account.  If
they elect to create a new account, they will be asked for:
  - First Name
  - Last Name
  - Email address (one)
  - Password
At this time, we do not attempt to verify their email address or to do a robot
check.  We'll add those capabilities later if we have enough abuse to suggest a
need for them.

Once they have either logged in or created an account, we'll give them a page
with a table of entries for each person they are registering.  For each person,
we ask:
  - First Name
  - Last Name
  - Email address
  - Cell phone
  - Pronouns
If the user has already registered anyone (including themselves), the rows will
be pre-filled with the information from those registrations.  Otherwise, the
first row will be pre-filled with the user's own information.  The user can
fill in as many rows as desired, up to but not exceeding the enrollment limit of
the class.  If the user has not registered anyone yet, the page will also ask
(once, not per person) how they learned about the class.

On successful submission:
  1.  The "how did you hear" response, if any, is recorded in the class data
      (once, not per student being registered).
  2.  If the first row was seeded with the user's own information, and the
      received first row has either the same name, the same email, or the same
      cell phone, update the user's person record with the information from the
      row.
  3.  All registrations by that user that are no longer listed on the form are
      removed.
  4.  All rows on the form are registered if they weren't already.
  5.  The user is sent an email detailing who's registered, as well as the
      logistics of the class.
  6.  The user is shown a confirmation page telling them to look for that email.

Submissions are blocked (atomically) if:
  - The submission would exceed the enrollment limit of the class.
  - Any row has a first name or last name but not both.
  - Any two rows have the same first name and last name.

Options for "how did you hear":
    Social Media, Neighborhood Association, Community Event, Word of Mouth,
