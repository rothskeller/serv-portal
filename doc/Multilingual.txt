= Bilingual Design =

This website supports bilingual access, English or Spanish.  (It is not a fully
multi-lingual design supporting any number of languages.)  To determine the
language in which to render a page, this site consults the following sources,
and follows the first one that gives an answer:

1.  If the user is logged in, the preferred language from their profile is used.
2.  If the URL is language-specific, the language is taken from it.  The only
    known example of this is /clases, which forces Spanish.
3.  If the URL has a language prefix (/en or /es).  These force the specified
    language, and the URL is then resolved as if they weren't there.
4.  If the user has a "lang=en" or "lang=es" cookie, that language is used.
5.  If the request has an Accept-Language header that prefers one language over
    the other, that language is used.
6.  If none of the above apply, English is used.

In all cases, the response sets the "lang=en" or "lang=es" cookie to show what
language was selected.  When creating a new user, the selected language during
the user creation process becomes the initial preferred language for that user.

Regardless of the selected language, not all pages are translated.  Some will
reply in English regardless of the selected language.  This does not change the
selected language to English.
