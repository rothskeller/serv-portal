# SunnyvaleSERV.org Email Service

## Incoming (i.e., Mailing Lists)

Incoming mail to SunnyvaleSERV.org is delivered to Amazon Simple Email Service
(SES), via MX DNS entries in the Dreamhost DNS servers.  SES has a ruleset for
incoming email that stores the mail in a S3 bucket and then invokes the
serv-mail Lambda function.

The serv-mail Lambda function is a Go executable whose source code is in the
maillist subdirectory of this repository.  It breaks the incoming messages into
three types:
  - Messages sent to known email lists.  These are handled as described below.
  - Responses to moderation requests.  Also described below.
  - Everything else gets forwarded to the administrative address.

Messages that are sent to known email lists are checked for compliance with
authorized sender rules, spam issues, etc.  If there are no issues, they are
resent out to all subscribers of the target list(s).  Each message is rewritten
for each subscriber with custom headers and footer.  If there are any issues
with the mail, it is sent as an attachment to a moderation request, to the
moderator(s) of the target list(s).

To approve a message, the moderator(s) merely need to reply to the moderation
request; when the lambda receives an incoming reply to a moderation request from
a valid moderator, it resends the original message to all subscribers as above.
To reject a message, the moderator(s) simply ignore the moderation request.

The set of known email lists, the allowed senders, moderators, and subscribers
of each, etc., are encoded in a single JSON file in the S3 bucket called
list-data.json.  This file is updated by the SunnyvaleSERV.org code whenever
list membership or configurations are changed.

Every few months, old messages should be cleaned out of the S3 bucket, and old
log files out of the repository.

## Outgoing

The SunnyvaleSERV.org website originates email in a number of cases:
  - Invitations to sign up for shifts
  - Daily log reports
  - Volunteer hours reminders and reports
  - Class registration confirmations
  - Password reset requests
All of these are sent through the same Amazon SES instance that handles the
email lists.
