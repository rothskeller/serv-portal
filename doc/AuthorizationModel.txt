The authorization model for SunnyvaleSERV.org is based around people,
organizations, privilege levels, roles, and lists.

People are individuals who are, or have at some point been, affiliated with
SERV.  Each person holds zero or more roles, and is on zero or more lists.

Organizations are the SERV organizations: CERT, Listos, SARES, and SNAP.  For
convenience, CERT is separated into CERT-Deployment and CERT-Training.  There is
also a special "Admin" organization.

The privilege levels in each organization grant specific privileges, as follows:
    Student:  can be on lists
    Member:   all Student privileges, plus:
              can view non-public files belonging to the organization
              can view roster of members of the organization
              may be able to view contact information of members of the
                  organization (depends on the organization)
    Leader:   all Member privileges, plus:
              can add/edit calendar events for the organization
              can view/edit attendance at events for the organization
              can add/remove people to roles associated with their organization
              can add/edit non-public files belonging to the organization
              can add new people to the system
              can view/edit names and contact info of any person
              can view clearances for any person
In addition, Leaders of the Admin organization:
              have the Leader privileges in all organizations, plus:
              can edit clearances of any person
              can add/edit/approve public files
              can reset passwords (to new random ones) and clear lockouts
Finally, there are a few things that can only be done by Webmasters:
              can add/remove organizations, roles, and lists
              can change other people's passwords (to specific strings)
              can set insecure passwords
              can remove a person from a list's unsubscribe set
              can turn off "unsubscribe all" for a person

Roles serve several functions:
  - They can convey membership in an organization, at a particular privilege
    level, to the people who hold them.
  - They can give people the titles that appear next to them in roster displays.
    (For this reason, the roles associated with an organization are ordered;
    if a person holds multiple roles within an organization, the highest
    priority role that has a title is the one whose title is displayed.)
  - They can group people within an organization, to display more targeted
    rosters.
  - They can subscribe people to lists, or allow people to subscribe themselves
    to lists.  They can also allow people to send messages to lists.
  - They can imply other roles, such that a person who is given role A
    automatically receives role B as well (and when they lose role A, they also
    lose role B).

Lists are used for distribution of messages to people.  There are two kinds of
list, email and SMS, but they largely work the same way.  Each list has a set of
people who are subscribed to it, a set of people who can send to it, and a set
of people who have unsubscribed from it.  To be subscribed to a list, a person
must hold one or more roles that grant subscription.  There are four different
subscription models that a role can grant its holders on a list:
  - AllowSubscribe: holders of the role are allowed to subscribe and unsubscribe
    themselves.  If they lose all roles that granted them subscription rights,
    they will be removed from the list.
  - AutoSubscribe: holders of the role are automatically subscribed to the list.
    They can unsubscribe themselves at will.  If they lose all roles that
    granted them subscription rights, they will be removed from the list.
  - ShouldSubscribe: same as AutoSubscribe, except that if they try to
    unsubscribe themselves, they will get a warning that they may lose the
    role(s) that granted them subscription rights with this model.
  - MustSubscribe: same as AutoSubscribe, except that if they unsubscribe
    themselves, they automatically lose the role(s) that granted them
    subscription rights with this model.  Note that the system will prevent
    granting a role with such subscription rights to a person who has previously
    unsubscribed from the list.

Note that when a person is removed from a list because they lose the role(s)
that granted subscription rights, they are not added to the set of people who
have "unsubscribed".  That only happens when the person in question actively
unsubscribes from the list.  If a person actively unsubscribes, the person will
never be re-subscribed, no matter what roles they have, until that unsubscribe
is canceled by that person or a webmaster.

In order to be able to log in to the web site, a person must satisfy all of
the following criteria:
  - They must have a username assigned.  (If they have one, it will usually be
    their email address.)
  - They must have a password.
  - Their disabled flag must not be set.
  - They must belong to at least one organization.
  - They must not have had too many recent failed login attempts.
Going forward, all new people added to the web site will have usernames and
passwords and will be able to log in.  However, many historical CERT students do
not have a username or password.
