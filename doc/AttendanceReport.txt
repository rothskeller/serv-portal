The attendance report displays information about who attended which events and
spent how many hours on them.  It is essentially a two-dimensional table, with
some subdivisions.

The vertical axis of the table, with labels on the left, is the people axis.
There are four options:
  - One row per organization
  - One row per person
  - One row per person*org, grouped by organization
  - One row per person*org, grouped by person

The horizontal axis of the table, with labels on the top, is the event axis.
There are 2 options:
  - Each column corresponds to an event, grouped by month
  - Each column corresponds to a month

The cells of the table can contain either the count of people attending, or the
cumulative hours reported.

The parameters to the report generation are:
  - The date range for the covered events.
  - The selection of event types to include.
  - The selection of organizations to include.
  - Whether to include people in targeted orgs with zero totals.
  - The column option (months only, or every event).
  - The row option (orgs only, people grouped by org, people only).
  - The cell option (attendance count or cumulative hours).
