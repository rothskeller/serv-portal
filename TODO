        View only.
Organization leader:
    Prior to volgistics dump:
        For that organization:
            Actual events:
                Edit attendance and hours
            "Other Hours"
                View if non-zero
        For other organizations:
            Not shown
    After volgistics dump:
        For that organization:
            Events with attendance or non-zero hours:
                View only
            Events with no attendance and no hours:
                Not shown
        For other organizations:
            Not shown
Webmaster:
    View and edit anything

Under no circumstances do events (or months) in the future show to anyone.

Generally speaking, whether things are editable depends on the month and the
person, i.e., is constant for everything returned in the API request.  The
exception is that org leaders can't edit "other hours".  That can be handled as
a readonly flag on the event in the response.  The event type is needed in the
response as well so that webmaster doesn't change the attendance type of an
other hours request.
