There are 45 forms on the site at present.

Many of them do not use class=form; thay are special purpose.  I need not
consider them further when designing a form infrastructure.

4 forms have been converted to use the new form infrastructure.
  pages/admin/classedit/classedit.go
  pages/admin/listedit/listedit.go
  pages/admin/listrole/listrole.go
  pages/admin/roleedit/roleedit.go

That leaves 30 forms that use the old form infrastructure.

  30 are left-aligned, 2-column forms (some of which perhaps could be 3-col)
  2 are left-aligned, 3-column forms
  2 are centered, 2-column forms
and:
  32 are method=POST
  2 are implicit method=GET:
    listeditRole returns a value through JavaScript and is never submitted
    register#2 displays a message and is only ever dismissed, never submitted

  23 are up-layer=parent, with various targets
  5 target themselves (continuations of reglogin)
  3 have no unpoly behavior
