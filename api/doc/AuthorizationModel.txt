Primary authorization concept is the team.  Teams have:
  - ID and name
  - Optional email distribution list
  - Parent (hierarchy) implying inclusion
  - Optional managing team(s)
    - Plus flag potentially allowing it to be managed by its own admins
    - Manage means add people to it, potentially creating them, and remove people from it
    - DPS Staff implicitly manages all teams except Webmasters
    - Webmasters implicitly manages all teams
  - Optional visibility team
    - Visibility means members of the other team can see the roster of this team
    - DPS Staff and Webmasters implicitly see all teams
  - List of members, and the roles held by each
  - List of roles (see below).  Every member of the team is assigned to exactly one of the team's roles.
  - Membership in Web Site Users (i.e., in any team) grants login privilege.

Secondary authorization concept is the role.  Roles have:
  - ID and name
  - Flag giving holders of this role admin rights on the team
    - Admin rights mean changing which roles team members hold, and adding and removing roles
    - Admin rights mean scheduling events for the team and recording attendance
    - Members of managing team(s) also have admin rights
  - Optional tie to a specified role on a different team
    - Keeps the holders of the two roles in lockstep
    - Implicitly adds and removes members to the team as needed to achieve this

A key object type is a person.  People have:
  - ID, first name, last name, email (used as username)
  - Optional phone number
  - Password and assorted security information
  - List of team memberships and the corresponding roles on those teams

Another key object type is an event.  Events have:
  - ID, date, name, city, and type
  - Optional number of hours
  - List of teams invited to the event
Events are visible to members of the teams invited to them.  Events can be
created, edited, and deleted by people who are admins of all of the invited
teams.  Attendance at events can be recorded by people who are admins of any of
the invited teams.

A future object type is a file.  Its permissions will be much like those of
events, i.e., tied to one or more teams and controlled by people who are admins
of all such teams.
